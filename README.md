# Java Foundations – Semester 1 @ ITMO 🧪🚀

Welcome to my personal archive of programming assignments completed during the first semester of the **"Introduction to Programming"** course at Computer Science program in ITMO University.

> This repository contains a collection of small Java console applications — each designed to solve a specific algorithmic or logic-based problem as part of weekly homework.

## 📚 Course Overview

Throughout the course, we were introduced to the **core principles of programming** using Java as the primary language. The focus was not just on syntax, but on **building a programmer's mindset**: clarity, modularity, testing, and iterative problem-solving.

- ✅ Passed automatic test validation
- ✅ Were code-reviewed
- ✅ Were plagiarism-checked

## 🔐 Note on Academic Integrity

> 📌 **This repository will be updated in Summer 2025**  
> Once the course grading period is officially over, I will also upload my larger Java project — a parser I developed as part of the final assignment.  
> I'm holding off to ensure full compliance with ITMO's academic integrity policy.
